<p>Single-serve git-over-i2p repositories using SAM.</p>

<p>This is still pretty much a toy. I made it as a goof after I got tired this
Saturday. I do intend to refine it as I get more chances to do so but for now
it's just for fun.</p>

<p>This simple application combines an I2P Tunnel created by sam-forwarder and a
git repository created by gitkit in order to simply host a Git repository over
the I2P network. It creates two tunnels that serve the same repository, one of
them is read-only and served with plain HTTP-over-I2P, and one of them is
read-write and served with SSH.</p>

<p>Soon, it will optionally add a post-recieve hook which will check out the latest
changes. That will essentially make the read-only branch <em>also</em> function as a
project web site for the code in the repository. Sort of like github pages.</p>

<p>Eventually, it will have extensive options for optimizing your git
configuration.</p>
